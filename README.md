To integrate a Flask endpoint into a FastAPI setup, you can follow these general steps:

    Install the flask package if it's not already installed:

bash

pip install flask

    Create a Flask endpoint as you normally would:

python

from flask import Flask

app_flask = Flask(__name__)

@app_flask.route('/my-flask-endpoint')
def my_flask_endpoint():
    return 'Hello from Flask!'

    Create a FastAPI endpoint that proxies the Flask endpoint:

python

from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.middleware.wsgi import WSGIMiddleware

app_fastapi = FastAPI()

# mount the Flask app as a sub application
app_fastapi.mount("/my-flask-endpoint", WSGIMiddleware(app_flask))

In the example above, we mount the Flask app as a sub-application of the FastAPI app using the WSGIMiddleware from the starlette package. This allows the Flask app to run under the same server as the FastAPI app, and makes it accessible through the /my-flask-endpoint path.

Now when you run your FastAPI app, the Flask endpoint will also be available under the path /my-flask-endpoint.
